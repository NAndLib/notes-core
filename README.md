# notes

Directory used to supplement note taking from anywhere on the computer.
All files should be written in LaTeX. The main file is generated by running:
```
make notes
```
or
```
notes make
```
A note can be made from within the repository by running:
```
notes [name]
```
Once a note is taken, running the same command again will open the note for
editing.

To use the `notes` command from anywhere, run:
`make install`
The variable `PREFIX` can be used to set the location for the executable.

The notes file will be edited by whatever editor is specified by `$EDITOR`, or
Vim by default.

To list other `notes` commands, run `notes help`. Similarly, to list all `make`
targets, run `make help`.
