# notes

Directory used to supplement note taking from anywhere on the computer.
All files should be written in LaTeX. The main file is generated by running:
```
make notes
```
or
```
notes make
```

A note can be made from within the repository by running:
```
notes [name]
```
If no name is provided, the current date will be the note's name.

Once a note is taken, running the same command again will open the note for
editing.

If no name is provided, the most recent note will be edited.

To take notes from anywhere, run: `make intsall`. Change `PREFIX` to the
location for the executable.

The notes file will be edited by whatever editor is specified by `$EDITOR`, or
Vi by default.

To list other `notes` commands, run `notes help`. Similarly, to list all `make`
targets, run `make help`.
