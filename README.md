# notes

This repository contains all notes that I've jotted down about anything. All
files are written in LaTeX. The main file is generated by running:
```
make notes
```
or
```
notes make
```

A note can be made from within the repository by running:
```
notes [name]
```
If no name is provided, the current date will be the note's name.

Once a note is taken, to edit the note, run:
```
notes edit [name]
```
If no name is provided, the most recent note will be edited.

To take notes from anywhere, append the full path to the repo to your `PATH`
variable.

The notes file will be edited by whatever editor is specified by `$EDITOR`, or
Vi by default.

To list other `notes` commands, run `notes help`. Similarly, to list all `make`
targets, run `make help`.
